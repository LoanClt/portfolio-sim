- ✅ Proper indexing for performance
- ✅ Automatic timestamp management

### 5. **Backend Service**
- ✅ Complete `SharedSimulationService` with all CRUD operations
- ✅ User validation via email lookup

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE shared_simulations (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  sender_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  recipient_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  recipient_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  sender_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  portfolio_data JSONB NOT NULL,        -- Array of portfolio investments
  simulation_params JSONB NOT NULL,     -- Simulation parameters
  custom_sets JSONB,                    -- Custom parameter sets used
  title TEXT,                           -- Optional title
  description TEXT,                     -- Optional description
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,        -- Read status
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Users can only view simulations they sent or received
- ✅ Users can only insert simulations they're sending
- ✅ Recipients can only update read status of their simulations
- ✅ Senders can only delete simulations they sent

### Validation
- ✅ Email format validation
- ✅ User existence checking
- ✅ Prevent self-sharing
- ✅ Portfolio data validation

## 🎨 User Experience

### Visual Indicators
- ✅ "New" badges for unread simulations
- ✅ Professional card layout with metadata
- ✅ Color-coded status indicators
- ✅ Sender/recipient information clearly displayed

### Notifications
- ✅ Success notifications for sharing/loading
- ✅ Error notifications for failures
- ✅ Integration with existing notification system
- ✅ Clear error messages for user guidance

### Workflow
1. **Sharing Process:**
   - User clicks "Share Simulation" button
   - Enters recipient email and optional details
   - System validates recipient exists
   - Simulation data is stored with metadata
   - Recipient receives access to shared simulation

2. **Receiving Process:**
   - User opens "View Shared" dialog
   - Sees list of received simulations with "New" badges
   - Can load simulation directly into workspace
   - System marks as read when loaded
   - Portfolio data, parameters, and custom sets are loaded

## 📊 Data Flow

### Share Simulation
```
Portfolio Data + Simulation Params + Custom Sets
        ↓
    ShareSimulationDialog (validation)
        ↓
    SharedSimulationService.shareSimulation()
        ↓
    Database Insert (with RLS)
        ↓
    Success Notification
```

### Load Shared Simulation
```
SharedSimulationsDialog
        ↓
    SharedSimulationService.getReceivedSharedSimulations()
        ↓
    User selects simulation to load
        ↓
    Data loaded into Index.tsx state
        ↓
    PortfolioManager syncs with new data
        ↓
    Mark as read in database
```
